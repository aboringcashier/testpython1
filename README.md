This is a sample about me page, 

But I think github is so cool, I noticed you can add a license to your code? That is so cool. 


I think its 
    great that you can even change the indent size for your code.


  I just changed it again!

Thank you for reading my README!




-- Onwards I am making a pull request to talk about the things I enjoy about github while adding some things I DO NOT.


1. Github is very user friendly
2. Github seems like a great place to make friends that also sharing coding interests.
3. Github allows you to experience coding in the way you want too, while also testing out others.


-- Dislikes

1. The UI is a bit bland, I could go for something a little more popped out... (Would be cool if you could edit your own design for it)
2. I am not a fan of the name Github.



   (final note: i'm glad i finally learned what forking a project means)
